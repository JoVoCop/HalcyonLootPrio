This is a crude addon that will display a tooltip on item to explain the Halcyon guild's (Whitemane-US) loot priority.
I found it cumbersome to look at a speadsheet on another monitor when voting on Loot Council loot. This addon brings the relevant priority information from that spreadsheet in-game.

Currently this only supports Ulduar 25. Our spreadsheet is based on Joardee's spreadsheet from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE2DWIUuRHM
Theoretically, `tools/generate-loot-list.py` should work for Joardee's list too


Short term goals:
* Rewrite properly. I created this in an hour or so - hacked together. I really should spend some time to follow best-practices

Long term goals:
* Make the prio data be customizable per user/guild (i.e. provide a function for importing custom loot prio rules making this a generic addon anyone could use)
